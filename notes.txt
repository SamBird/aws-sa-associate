IAM
- PCI DSS Compliant (card details)
- You can set up a password rotation policy
- Multi-factor etc

- Users: End Users (people) i.e. employees of an organisations
- Group: Collection of users, users in a group inherit permissions
- Policies: Can be attached to User/Group/Role and give permissions as to what can and can't do
- Roles: To be assiged to AWS resources

- New users have no permissions when first created, assign them to a group with permissions arttached.
- New users are assigned access and secret keys to access AWS programatically
- These cannot be used to log into the console / password field
- Only get to view them once, save CSV file in location
- Enable MFA on root account 
- Create and customize your own password rotation policies
- Billing Alarm

S3
- Object-based, i.e allows you to upload files
- 0 Bytes to 5TB
- Unlimited Storage
- Stored in Buckets
- S3 objects consist of the following:
    - Key, 
    - Value,
    - Version ID,
    - Metadata, 
    - Subresources (Access Control Lists - the permissions of an object/bucket)
- S3 is a universal namespace. That is, names must be unique globally.

Data Consistency for S3
- Read after Write consistency for PUTS of new objects. (If you upload a file to S3 you can read it immidiately after)
- Eventual Consistency for overwrite PUTS and DELETES (can take some time to propergate) (If you overwrite one you may get the wrong version back while it properagates through)

Guarantees from Amazon
- 99.9% availability 
- 11 9s of durability (virtually impossible of being lost)

Features
- Tired Storage (need to know for exam 4-5 points worth)
- Lifecycle Management
- Versioning
- Encyption (at REST)]
- MFA to Delete objects 
- Use Access Control and policies to control the Data

S3 Storage Classes
- S3 Standard
- S3 IA (Infrequenclty Accessed - accesed less frequently, but when needed it's rapid to retreive)
- S3 One Zone - IA (Lower cost than the above, in 1 AZ)
- S3 Intelligent Tiering (ML to ompitimxe cost of your objects byt moving objects around)
- S3 Glacier (for data acrchiving, low-cost storage, retreival time configurable from minutes to hours)
- S3 Glacier Deep Archive (same as above but retreival time of 12 hours is acceptable)

S3 Charges
- Storage (amount, number of objects)
- Number of requests to GET, DELETE etc.
- Storage Management Pricing (i.e the option / storage class used)
- Data Transfer Pricing
- Transfer Acceleration (speeds up user upload time - fast and secure transfer of files over long distances between buckets and end users by using AWS CloudFront edge locations via optiomized network path)
- Cross Region Replication Pricing

S3 Exam Tips
- Object based, so you can't do things like install an OS on it (obviously)
- Successful uploads will generate a HTTP 200 status code.
- MFA Delete
- Read the S3 FAQ's, it comes up ALOT!

- By default, all created buckets are PRIVATE access.
- S3 logs can be set up to audit/log all requests to bucket and objects
- Encryption in transit (i.e HTTPS) is acheived by SSL/TLS
- Encryption at rest (server-side) is acheived: 
    - S3 managed keys SSE-S3 (AES-256), AWS SSE-KMS Keys, Custom SSE-KMS Keys. 

Versioning
- Once enabled, versioning cannot be disabled - you need to re-create the bucket 
- Great backup tool 
- Integrates with lifecycle rules
- Permissions change on the file with versioning when you re-upload (as treats it as a new file)
- Version ID keeps it unique.
